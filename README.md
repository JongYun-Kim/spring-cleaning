## Cleaning Tasks

### Things to Know Beforehand

**Wiping**: Wipe with something clean and damp (wet wipes, a damp cloth, etc.), then remove moisture with something dry. (If using toilet roll, be careful not to leave behind tissue residue.)

**Deep clean**: Clean using cleaning products/detergent. However, you **must** check whether there is any food or dishes nearby and move them out of the way before starting. Be especially careful if the product contains active bleach (e.g. *NaOCl*). In other words, if it’s not something you’d happily drench your food in, be careful with it. Also think carefully about ventilation when deep cleaning.

**Mopping**: Use a mop, or get on your hands and knees with wet wipes to wipe every corner. With a mop, a small amount of active bleach is fine since it’s a surface you walk on anyway. With wet wipes by hand, only the part you press down on actually gets wet, so pay attention to whether the floor is actually getting wet and aim for 100% coverage. Before mopping, check for and clear any loose debris on the floor if possible.

> ***Caution***: Active bleach must only be rinsed with cold water. Using lukewarm or hot water will cause it to become airborne and enter your respiratory system.

### Living Room

- [x] Wipe the dining table
- [x] Tidy up books and other items neatly (categorise items, arrange by size so it looks natural, keep the arrangement clean and not cluttered — exceptions allowed if there’s an aesthetic reason). This applies to your personal belongings only.
- [x] Wipe the exposed floor/surface area where you tidied the books, etc.
- [x] Tidy your own shoes
- [x] Wipe the top of the fake fireplace (the roughly horizontal surfaces where dust may have accumulated)

### Kitchen

- [x] Wipe inside the oven
- [x] Wipe/deep clean the dish drying rack (limescale, mould)
- [x] Deep clean the surface underneath the dish drying rack in the sink area
- [x] Remove stains from the sink (this is not easy, so put in the effort. You can use bleach-based products — use detergent and also scrub hard physically. Rinsing off residual detergent thoroughly is also important.)
- [ ] If you have sauces, powders, or other cooking ingredients in your personal cupboard, take them out and wipe the cupboard floor

### Bathroom

- [x] Throw away any personal items you no longer need
- [x] Remove limescale from the sink (including the tap)
- [x] Remove limescale from the bathtub
- [x] Mop the floor (move any items/objects out of the way first before mopping)
- [x] The toilet — Thanks Z!

### Stairs/Hallway

- [x] Vacuum the stairs
- [x] Remove any dead spiders from the stairway ceiling
- [x] Vacuum the hallways at the top and bottom of the stairs

### Floors (Living Room, Kitchen, Bathroom)

- [x] Vacuum (if there are movable items on the floor, move them out of the way first. If an item physically blocks the floor on all sides such that dust can barely get under it — e.g. desk legs, cupboards, chest of drawers — you don’t need to move it.) — When pushing the vacuum forward, do not go faster than 20 cm/s. Going faster than that will not remove dust properly.

### Personal Room

- [ ] Ventilate (at least 30 minutes; open doors and windows and ensure there is an airflow path through the house from a structural standpoint)

- [ ] Vacuum the floor (not only under the desk)
